Experiments with DCGAN (in tensorflow) using images of dancers to teach the GAN's discriminator.
The dataset consists of diverse images found on the web. Given the inconsistency of the dataset, it is not expected that realistic images will be produced.

The following animated GIF shows images generated while the discriminator was taught during 200 iterations:

and during 2000 iterations:
